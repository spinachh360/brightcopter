            OUR STORY
          </p>
          <h2>
            A home is made
            <br />
            of little moments.
          </h2>
          <p>
            A quiet morning. A favourite meal. A room that feels just right. The
            appliances we live with become part of those everyday moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bright Copter offers Base model, Jumbohead model and Nanohead model fans,
            with product guidance and local support from
            Parappur in Thrissur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our identity celebrates the connection between a lion and its cub —
            a reminder of the care, reassurance and lasting bond we want every
            customer relationship to reflect.
          </p>
          <blockquote>“Long lasting bonding like a father.”</blockquote>
